# datasets
Synthetic and real-world atasets for evaluating machine learning algorithms. Each dataset is stored in a .MAT file with the following variables:
* Xtr - Training data. It is a matrix of size D x Ntrain.
* Ytr - Training class labels. It is a vector of size 1 x Ntrain.
* Xtt - Test data. It is a matrix of size D x Ntest.
* Ytt - Test class labels. It is a vector of size 1 x Ntest.
* info - Structure with information about the dataset.
